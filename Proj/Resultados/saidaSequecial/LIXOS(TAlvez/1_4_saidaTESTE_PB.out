The following command line options and corresponding MCA parameter have
been deprecated and replaced as follows:

  Command line options:
    Deprecated:  --cpus-per-proc, -cpus-per-proc, --cpus-per-rank, -cpus-per-rank
    Replacement: --map-by <obj>:PE=N, default <obj>=NUMA

  Equivalent MCA parameter:
    Deprecated:  rmaps_base_cpus_per_proc
    Replacement: rmaps_base_mapping_policy=<obj>:PE=N, default <obj>=NUMA

The deprecated forms *will* disappear in a future version of Open MPI.
Please update to the new syntax.

WARNING: a request was made to bind a process. While the system
supports binding the process itself, at least one node does NOT
support binding memory to the process location.

  Node:  tpnode01

This usually is due to not having the required NUMA support installed
on the node. In some Linux distributions, the required support is
contained in the libnumactl and libnumactl-devel packages.
This is a warning only; your job will continue, though performance may be degraded.

mpirun detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing
the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:
